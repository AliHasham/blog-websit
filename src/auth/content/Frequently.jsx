                                Contest is 14 hours. Each time  a set of 8 to 12 short problems will be given.
                                Some problems require only
                                basic knowledge of the programming. Other problems require strong knowledge of basic
                                mathematics, data structures and strong knowledge of algorithms.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong><b><span style={{ color: "#339966" }}>What is the style of the problems?</span> </b>
                                The style of problems follows from the famous ACM International Collegiate Programming
                                Contest (ICPC). The best way to see the style of problems is to view archives of the ACM ICPC: <strong>

                            <li><strong><b><span style={{ color: "#339966" }}>How do the team members contribute to solve a problem? Does each team member have a specific task?</span> </b>
                                The team members should browse the problem set and attempt to identify the problems that can be solved by them with confidence. Then, they work together, as a team,
                                to solve the problem. If successful, they submit the problem through the software interface provided, and
                                they continue in this process for the duration of the contest.</strong></li>

                            >For each problem, students are given a sample input and a correct sample output that should
                                be expected. Once their program is working (or seems to be working), they can submit their solution.
                                The solution will be run against a larger set of input from the judges; this input set is more compr
                                ehensive, with the intention of testing all possible cases. Students should pay close attention
                                to the input and output description to make sure they have correctly considered all possible
                                scenarios. Upon running the student submission, if the teamâ€™s output matches the judges output,
                                then the team submission is accepted.</strong></li>
